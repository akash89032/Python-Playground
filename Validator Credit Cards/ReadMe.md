# Credit Card Validation Class

The Credit Card Validation Class is a Python class that allows you to perform various checks on a credit card number to determine its validity, identify the card's company, and more. This class is designed to help you verify credit card information programmatically.

## Features

- Identify the credit card company (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) based on the card number.
- Perform a length check to ensure the card number has a valid length.
- Validate credit card information using the Luhn algorithm.
- Display the card's checksum.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**

   - To run this Python script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-validation.git
   ```

3. **Run the Script**

   To start using the Credit Card Validation class, create an instance of the `CreditCard` class and provide a card number as an argument. Then, you can call various methods to perform checks on the card number.

   ```python
   card_number = input('Enter a card number: ')
   card = CreditCard(card_number)
   print(card.company)
   print("Card : ", card.card_no)
   print(card.first_check())
   print(card.checksum)
   print(card.validate_card_information())
   ```

4. **Enjoy Card Validation**

   Use the class to validate credit card numbers and obtain information about the card's company and validity.
