# Website Summarization Tool

The Website Summarization Tool is a Python application that allows you to generate summaries of websites by simply providing a link. It employs the Beautiful Soup and OpenAI libraries to scrape website content and generate concise summaries.

## How it Works

This tool follows a straightforward process to summarize websites:

1. **Web Scraping:** The tool utilizes Beautiful Soup to scrape the main content of the given website.

2. **Text Summarization:** The extracted content is passed to the OpenAI GPT-3 language model, which generates a summary of the website.

3. **User Output:** The generated summary is then returned to the user, providing a quick and effective way to understand the content of a website.
